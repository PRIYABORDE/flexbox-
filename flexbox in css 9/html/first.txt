What is CSS Flexbox?
            The CSS Flexbox Layout Module defines a box model optimized for user interface design. It allows you to arrange items within a container along a single dimension (either horizontally or vertically).
        In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction.
        These items can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent containe

Key Concepts:
    Flex Container: To use the Flexbox model, you first define a flex container. It represents the area where flex items are placed.
    Flex Items: These are the individual elements within the flex container that participate in the flexible layout.
    Main Axis: The primary direction along which flex items are laid out (either horizontally or vertically).
    Cross Axis: The perpendicular direction to the main axis.

Common Flex Properties:

flex-direction: Determines the main axis direction (row or column).
justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis.
align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis.
